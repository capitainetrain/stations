It is possible to visualize and edit the data with https://trainline-eu.github.io/stations-studio. In order to make pull requests, you must be member of Trainline EUâ€™s organisation. However it is possible to download the modified file without creating a pull request.

Please note: Changes to station names here not only impact what is shown in the search widget and booking flow, but also the SEO landing page URLs. For more info please see this [wiki](www.placeholder.com) on how the "SEO slugs" logic is implemented and the impact of updating a station name.
