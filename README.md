## The Data

The file `stations.csv` contains all our data representing train stations. The file is UTF-8 encoded text file and Comma Separated Value (CSV) formatted – although a semi-colon `;` is used to delimitate fields.

### Columns

Column Name | Notes
----------- | -----
`id` | Internal unique identifier.
`name` | Name of the station as it is locally known; see `info_*` for translations.
`slug` | Guaranteed to be unique across all the _suggestable_ stations; see `is_suggestable`.
`uic` | The UIC code of the station.
`uic8_sncf` | SNCF sometimes uses an UIC code with 8 digits instead of 7. The last digit is a checksum.
`longitude` | Coordinates as decimal value.
`latitude` | Coordinates as decimal value.
`parent_station_id` | A station can belong to a _meta station_ whose `id` is this value, i.e. _Paris Gare d’Austerlitz_ belongs to the metastation _Paris_.
`is_city` | This value is unreliable.
`country` | 2 letters, [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
`is_main_station` | This value is unreliable.
`time_zone` | [Continent/Country ISO codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
`is_suggestable` | Can the user input this station.
`sncf_self_service_machine` | Presence of a SNCF self-service machine at the station.
`same_as` | Some systems allow stations to be split in two, with two `id` values. If provided, the station identified by the given value should be considered as the actual station.

#### Operator Specific

Operator specific columns contain identifiers and values specific to the operator. Columns are prefixed with a name unique to the operator.

Column Name | Notes
----------- | -----
*`_id` | id of the station as it is known by the carrier.
*`_is_enabled` | Can a ticket be booked to/from the station through that carrier?
`sncf_id` |
`sncf_is_enabled` |
`idtgv_id` |
`idtgv_is_enabled` |
`db_id` |
`db_is_enabled` |
`hkx_id` |
`hkx_is_enabled` |
`busbud_id` |
`busbud_is_enabled` |
`ouigo_id` |
`ouigo_is_enabled` |
`trenitalia_id` |
`trenitalia_is_enabled` |
`ntv_id` |
`ntv_is_enabled` |

#### Internationalisation

Language specific `info` columns contain translations of the station name. The language used is suffixed as an [ISO 639-1:2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code.

Column Name | Notes
----------- | -----
`info:`* | Extra information that is useful in the specific language.
`info:fr` |
`info:en` |
`info:de` |
`info:it` |
