This file contains all informations we use to identify a station in any system of the carriers.

## Licence

The file `stations.csv` is distributed under the ODbL licence (see `LICENCE.txt`). In short,
any modification to this data source must be published.

Data sources include [Openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) and [SNCF OpenData](https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/referentiel-gares-voyageurs/) that are under ODbL or compatible and a lot of sweat, tears and blood.

## The data

The file `stations.csv` contains all our data representing stations. Here is an explanation of the columns:

* `id`: our internal unique identifier
* `name`: the name of the station as it is locally known (see `info_*` for translations)
* `slug`: it is guaranteed to be unique across all the _suggestable_ stations (see `is_suggestable`)
* `uic`: the UIC code of the station
* `uic8_sncf`: the SNCF sometimes uses an UIC code with 8 digits instead of 7. The last digit is a checksum
* `longitude`, `latitude`: coordinates as decimals values
* `parent_station_id`: a station might belong to a _meta station_ whose `id` is this value. For instance _Paris Gare dâ€™Austerlitz`_ belongs to the metastation _Paris_
* `is_city`, `is_main_station`: this value is not reliable
* `country`: 2 letter ISO code
* `timezone`: as [Continent]/[country] ISO code
* `is_suggestable`: can the user input this station
* `[carrier]_id`: the id of the station as it is known by the carrier
* `[carrier]_is_enabled`: can a ticket be booked to/from the station through that carrier
* `info:[lang]`: extra information that is useful in the specific language
* `same_as`: in some systems, a station can be split in two, with two `id`. If this value is set, the station pointed by that value should be considered as the actual station
